# GitHub Actions

We have a pack of GitHub Actions that let you manage an already running JetStream Server, useful for managing releases or standing up test infrastructure.

Full details and examples are in the [jetstream-gh-actions](https://github.com/nats-io/jetstream-gh-action) repository, here's an example.

```yaml
on: push
name: orders
jobs:

  # First we delete the ORDERS stream and consumer if they already exist
  clean_orders:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: orders_stream
        uses: nats-io/jetstream-gh-action/delete/stream@master
        with:
          missing_ok: 1
          stream: ORDERS
          server: js.example.net

  # Now we create the Stream and Consumers using the same configuration files the 
  # nats CLI utility would use as shown above
  create_orders:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: clean_orders
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: orders_stream
        uses: nats-io/jetstream-gh-action/create/stream@master
        with:
          config: ORDERS.json
          server: js.example.net
      - name: orders_new_consumer
        uses: nats-io/jetstream-gh-action/create/consumer@master
        with:
          config: ORDERS_NEW.json
          stream: ORDERS
          server: js.example.net

  # We publish a message to a specific Subject, perhaps some consumer is 
  # waiting there for it to kick off tests
  publish_message:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: create_orders
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: orders_new_consumer
        uses: nats-io/jetstream-gh-action@master
        with:
          subject: ORDERS.deployment
          message: Published new deployment via "${{ github.event_name }}" in "${{ github.repository }}"
          server: js.example.net
```

# Agent Instructions
This documentation is published with GitBook. GitBook is the documentation platform designed so that both humans and AI agents can read, navigate, and reason over technical content effectively. Learn more at gitbook.com.

## Querying This Documentation
If you need additional information that is not directly available in this page, you can query the documentation dynamically by asking a question.

Perform an HTTP GET request on the current page URL with the `ask` query parameter, and the optional `goal` query parameter:

```
GET https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/resource_management/configuration_mgmt/github_actions.md?ask=<question>&goal=<endgoal>
```

`ask` is the immediate question: it should be specific, self-contained, and written in natural language.
`goal` is optional and describes the broader end goal you are ultimately trying to accomplish on behalf of the user. GitBook uses it to tailor the answer towards what is most useful for that goal.

The response will contain a direct answer to the question and relevant excerpts and sources from the documentation.

Use this mechanism when the answer is not explicitly present in the current page, you need clarification or additional context, or you want to retrieve related documentation sections.
