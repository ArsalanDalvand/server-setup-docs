# Authenticating with an NKey

The 2.0 version of NATS server introduces a new challenge response authentication option. This challenge response is based on a wrapper we call [NKeys](/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth.md). The server can use these keys in several ways for authentication. The simplest is for the server to be configured with a list of known public keys and for the clients to respond to the challenge by signing it with its private key. (A printable private NKey is referred to as seed). This challenge-response ensures security by ensuring that the client has the private key, but also protects the private key from the server, which never has access to it!

Handling challenge response may require more than just a setting in the connection options, depending on the client library.

This documentation is published with GitBook. GitBook is the documentation platform designed so that both humans and AI agents can read, navigate, and reason over technical content effectively. Learn more at gitbook.com.

## Querying This Documentation
If you need additional information that is not directly available in this page, you can query the documentation dynamically by asking a question.

Perform an HTTP GET request on the current page URL with the `ask` query parameter, and the optional `goal` query parameter:

```
GET https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/connecting/nkey.md?ask=<question>&goal=<endgoal>
```

`ask` is the immediate question: it should be specific, self-contained, and written in natural language.
`goal` is optional and describes the broader end goal you are ultimately trying to accomplish on behalf of the user. GitBook uses it to tailor the answer towards what is most useful for that goal.

The response will contain a direct answer to the question and relevant excerpts and sources from the documentation.

Use this mechanism when the answer is not explicitly present in the current page, you need clarification or additional context, or you want to retrieve related documentation sections.
